# SpamClassifier
The "Spam Classifier" project is a university project where we built a spam classifier using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. We employed five different algorithms, including four machine learning algorithms and one deep learning algorithm, to train models capable of accurately classifying emails as spam or non-spam.
